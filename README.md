![preview of order summary card](./preview.jpg)

This is a challenge from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/). Coded by [me](https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/Martin-K-Kamir)! üòÅ

Welcome to the repository for this project. Feel free to look around and expore! üòÄ

### Tools

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/)
- [AOS](https://github.com/michalsnik/aos#animations)
- [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/)
- [open-props](https://open-props.style/)
- [gerillass](https://gerillass.com/)

### Development

With this project i wanted to use css grid for the whole layout. I thought i could do the overlapping layout without subgrid but it's not possible. Without the subgrid i had to use different approach with paddings. Which worked fine but i'm not happy with that. Because having larger website with multiple components would be harder for managing etc.
